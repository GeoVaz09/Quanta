# Quanta 🚀  
*A Programming Language by GeoVaz09*  

**This README was generated with AI assistance.**

---

## 🧩 Overview  
**Quanta** is a custom programming language designed and implemented by GeoVaz09. It features its own syntax and interpreter made with Python. 

---

## ⚙️ Features  
- **Custom syntax**: BAD and NOT easy to learn. (I would consider it an esolang)
- **Interpreter**: interactive execution with almost no debugging help  
- **Built-in standard library**: basic math, data structures.  
- **Tooling**: CLI for running code, error reporting (for at leist 2 command and that's it ;)  ).

---

🧪 Example

A minimal hello.txt example:

print; Hello World
