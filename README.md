## ⚙️ Features  
- **Custom syntax**: BAD and NOT easy to learn. (I would consider it an esolang)
- **Interpreter**: interactive execution with almost no debugging help  
- **Built-in standard library**: basic math, data structures.  
- **Tooling**: CLI for running code, error reporting (for at leist 2 command and that's it ;)  ).
