## 🧩 Overview  

**Quanta** is a custom programming language with a Python-based interpreter, designed for experimentation, pain and confusion. (I would consider it an esolang). 

The project includes two built-in CLI games:

🎮 Rock, Paper, Scissors – A classic game against the computer.

🔢 Bigger or Smaller – A number guessing game where players try to guess the correct number in the fewest attempts. (Max. 10 attempts)

Both games showcase Quanta's ability to handle user input, logic, and control flow — making it one of the worst ;) starting point for learning and exploring programming through custom language design (which is mostly made with bad code).

## ⚙️ Features  
- **Custom syntax**: BAD and NOT easy to learn. (I would consider it an esolang)
- **Interpreter**: interactive execution with almost no debugging help
- **Built-in standard library**: basic math, data structures.  (I think, I am not quite sure if it is even turing-complete)
